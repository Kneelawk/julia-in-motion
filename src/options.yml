  - path:
      short: p
      long: path
      value_name: PATH
      help: >-
        Sets the path along the Mandelbrot set on the complex plane for the video of the Julia set to follow.
      takes_value: true
      required: true
  - mandelbrot:
      short: m
      long: mandelbrot
      help: >-
        Generates a video of cross-hairs tracing a path along a Mandelbrot set instead of a Julia set tracing that path.
